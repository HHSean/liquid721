## About
This project is built as an inspiration of NFTfi, to fix the illiquidity of NFT. However, the peer to peer mechanic require borrower to wait until someone willing to accept his loan request. Thus, I've built a liquidity pool for borrower to get instant loan, capped at 50% of the NFT floor price. However, due to lack of time, I only managed to finished to backend of liquidity pool, integrated with Chainlink Any API.

## How I built it
### Frontend
Next.JS React framework

### Backend
Smartcontract
Solidity, Hardhat, Chainlink(to fetch NFT floor price)

## Sponsor tools used

Chainlink: to fetch NFT floor price
Sequence Wallet: integrate login with sequence wallet
